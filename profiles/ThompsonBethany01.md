Hello! I'm Beth from San Antonio, Texas and am currently attending a coding bootcamp for Data Science. 
A lot of my projects are for class, but I've got some fun projects as well. Check out my project 
based on the movie Office Sapce [here](https://github.com/ThompsonBethany01/Office-Space). My
interests include reading a good scy-fy book and being creative in my work! This is my first 
Hacktoberfest, so I am new to the open source community.
